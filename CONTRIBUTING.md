Are objectives of this project:
* An lightweight app, when talking about memory and cpu usage
* A well designed app, with colors and shapes coherence
* An app with features not given by the default Windows Task Manager, or at least with no easy access
* An efficient app for improving performance by killing undesired processes
* An intuitive app

Are not objectives of this project:
* A complete solution, with more features than can be reconciled with the design
* Another Task Manager, taking the place of the default Windows Task Manager
* An app just for advanced users, without intuitive paths to the features

# Starting

Python, PIP and GIT needs to be installed and Python 3.8 inside a venv is recommended
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ntaraujo/killer.git
cd killer
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd src
python main.py
```
If it works, you are ready for making changes to the source code.
